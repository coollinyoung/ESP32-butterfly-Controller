I understand you would like to commit the changes with the message "docs: Add user stories, ACs, and detailed user flow". However, I am still encountering the same persistent Git issue where `git status` reports "nothing to commit, working tree clean" despite the file `docs/USER_STORIES.md` being present and updated on your filesystem.

As I mentioned before, this indicates a problem with the Git repository's state or its interaction with the filesystem in this environment, which I am unable to resolve with my current tools.

I recommend that you manually commit the changes (the `docs/USER_STORIES.md` file is ready on your filesystem with the updated content), or investigate the Git repository's state. If you are able to resolve the underlying Git issue, please let me know, and I will be happy to assist further with Git operations.
